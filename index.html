                <h4>Colorado Ranger Horse Lineage</h4>
                <p>The Colorado Ranger Horse is one that is registered with the Colorado Ranger Horse Association, Inc. (CRHA), which is one of the oldest western horse breed registries still in existence in the United States.  To meet the requirements for registration with the CRHA, a horse must show a direct descent from at least one of the two foundation stallions, 'Max #2' and 'Patches #1'. </p>

                <h4>Appaloosa Markings</h4>
               <p>While many Colorado Rangerbreds have appaloosa markings, CRHA is not a color registry.  Because CRHA is a 'bloodline' registry, it doesn't matter if the horse is a solid color or shows the coloration variations typical of the appaloosa.  If you have a registered Appaloosa, chances are one in eight that your stallion, mare, or gelding is eligible for CRHA registration, as well.</p>
